To run this app you must have PHP installed on your machine then execute CMD command in app directory:
> php -S localhost:8080 <You can change the "8080" part to another port if this one is taken. (max port range: 9999)>

Then you can paste or type in your browser this:
> localhost:8080

Now you're able to take a look at my application!
